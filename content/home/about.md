I am a PhD student at the University of Cambridge, using data-driven methods to gain insight on the physical processes that enable battery energy storage.

I study the optical properties of graphene at high charge carrier densities, using Raman spectroscopy to learn about its electronic structure. I also study the breakdown of silicon anodes - these are of particular interest, since they represent one of the key technologies which may replace current Li-ion batteries in the near future.

I further Raman spectroscopy to probe the vibrational states in such systems, using phonon confinement models to interpret the spectra and learn about the evolution of the particle size distribution as the battery is discharged.
