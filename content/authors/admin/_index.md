I am a PhD student at the University of Cambridge, using data-driven methods to gain insight on the physical processes which cause the breakdown of silicon anodes - these are of particular interest, since they represent one of the key technologies which may replace current Li-ion batteries in the near future.

I use Raman spectroscopy to probe the vibrational states in such systems, using phonon confinement models in interpret the spectra and learn about the evolution of the size distribution as the battery is discharged.
